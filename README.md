Die Simulator Project
Python-based Simulation of Rolling Dice with Enhanced Features
Technologies: Python, Random Module, Collections Module (Counter)

Developed a Python program to simulate rolling one or multiple dice with real-time user input.
Implemented features for tracking roll history and displaying statistics on the most frequent rolls.
Utilized random module for simulating dice rolls and collections.Counter to count roll occurrences.
Designed user-friendly interface with options to roll multiple dice, view roll history, and display statistical insights.
Enhanced code with loops and conditional logic to ensure continuous interaction and seamless functionality.
Key Features:

Multiple Dice Roll: Allows rolling of one or more dice with custom input.
Roll History: Keeps a log of all rolls made during the session.
Statistics: Displays the most frequent roll in real-time.
Modular Code: Clean and reusable functions for future expansion (e.g., adding custom die faces).
Outcome:

Strengthened understanding of Pythonâ€™s random number generation and data analysis using collections.
Improved skills in interactive user interfaces and statistical feature development.
